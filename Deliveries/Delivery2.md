## Requirements


## Prototyping
### Method description

For prototyping we decided to follow the method called "Gathering requirements from use cases". This method is an adaptation of the method proposed in the paper entitled [Desarrollo y generación de interfaces de usuario a partir de
técnicas de análisis de tareas y casos de uso](https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/925/92561610.pdf).

This methodology consist of four main levels:
- Requirement level: From a Use Case, the actors and steps necessary to meet the objective are identified.
- Analysis level: The steps identified above are categorized into user, application, interactive, and abstract tasks. These tasks, together with the actors, allow us to identify a series of classes and their relationships that will help define the behavior of the system.
- Design level: With the information obtained so far, a series of diagrams are built to understand the interactions and possible components of the system.
- Implementation level: With the help of guidelines and the identified components, low fidelity wireframes are proposed.
