## Requirements
With the information obtained from the first phase of the UCD and some complementary interviews, we elaborated the system [Software Requirements Specification](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Aid7glBVSnKngZsmhGh8Exrow0LLhw?e=2oCysR).


## Prototyping
### Method description

For prototyping we decided to follow the method called "Gathering requirements from use cases". This method is an adaptation of the method proposed in the paper entitled [Desarrollo y generación de interfaces de usuario a partir de
técnicas de análisis de tareas y casos de uso](https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/925/92561610.pdf).

This methodology consist of four main levels:
- Requirement level: From a Use Case, the actors and steps necessary to meet the objective are identified.
- Analysis level: The steps identified above are categorized into user, application, interactive, and abstract tasks. These tasks, together with the actors, allow us to identify a series of classes and their relationships that will help define the behavior of the system.
- Design level: With the information obtained so far, a series of diagrams are built to understand the interactions and possible components of the system.
- Implementation level: With the help of guidelines and the identified components, low fidelity wireframes are proposed.

For more information about the methodology steps, checkout the following [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kqvVJMVD-xUobWbfI_EAuhveyAGOWU5vhTxA0HmMPCg/edit?usp=sharing).

### Method implementation
Here is the [method implementation](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Aid7glBVSnKngZso40ZJD7R1teST_Q?e=n32EZK) to create prototypes from different Use Cases.

## :handshake: Contributions

The following table contains the activities that were planned out during this second delivery as well as its value (basing it off of the amount of time it took to accomplish each activity) as well as the person who was in charge of the activity in question.

All activities will have a value from 1 to 3 depending on the amount of time it took to accomplish said activity, as previously mentioned.

| Activity          | Value | Participants          |
