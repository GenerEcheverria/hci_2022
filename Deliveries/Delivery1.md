## Definition of the problem 

According to the Censo de Poblacion y Vivienda 2020 by INEGI, over 53 percent of students from 19 to 25 years need to move through public transportation. 

In our student community, several use busses to reach the facilities. Some of them face problems like excessive payments for taking more than 2 different bus routes and time expending. Also, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, even if our university has implemented measures such as the use of mandatory face masks, there are situations that the university can´t cover, such as getting infected of COVID by using intensively public transportation.  

The use of public transport for our colleagues can bring with it difficulties and be unsafe because it is a source of contagion, that’s why we present an initiative where university students share their vehicle with others near their habitual route to reach the facilities. 

The users who will be able to participate will be exclusively students of the faculty. The students who own a vehicle could receive a commission for their help when putting it at the service of their classmates, and the students who use the service, would obtain a fast, safe, and efficient transport.  

## Project plan

## About our users
### Research methods
#### Surveys
This is the main technique to collect user data because of time limitations, asking for both demographics, transportation needs and behavioral driver/passenger aspects. The implementation of the instrument exists as a [Google Forms survey](https://forms.gle/psQhjL47TThQpDzL7).
#### Experts interview
In addition to the transport situation of each student and their thoughts about the ride sharing initiative, we decided to interview the lawyer Elsy Chi, about the legal implications of carrying passengers, for building a higher level understanding needs of the proposal. The [interview](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Aid7glBVSnKngZpdwodBTs7c63_2sQ?e=wzw5PR) was realized in person and aims to collect qualitative data.
